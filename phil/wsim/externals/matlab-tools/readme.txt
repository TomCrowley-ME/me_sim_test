Only very simple tools that do not breach any intellectual property agreement go here. 
DO NOT put anything in here that you do not want to share! By putting files in this folder
you give up any claims over them. (see MIT license in license.txt)

Some files may come from internet, so they don't include the license (and they're not subject to it)
