DESCRIPTION

In history, this file defines a skeleton of functions to be used for accessing
the PCI bus capabilities.  These functions allow PCI device drivers 
to be written independent of the underlying O/S's PCI access mechanisms.

The name of each function in this group begins with "usb" to represent
"Device Driver Services."
