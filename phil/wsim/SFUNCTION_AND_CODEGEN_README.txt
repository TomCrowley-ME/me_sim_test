== OVERVIEW ==
This file is in reference to the following three S-Functions:

    sfun_hmg
    sfun_orb
    sfun_tcp

Consult the steps below to regen the corresponding .tlc and .cpp files for the S-Functions 

== MAKING NEW TLC FILES ==
The .tlc files can be generated by calling gen_legacy_code_xxx:

ex:
    >> nimbus_set_path
    >> gen_legacy_code_hmg

The above code will generate the .tlc files for sfun_hmg. 

== MAKING NEW C-MEX FILES == 
The script from the previous section will also generate a sfun_xxx.c file. To make it usable, 
it requires a small modification before it can be compiled. 

1. Open the sfun_xxx.c file. Below the list of #include statements, insert the lines:
    
    extern "C" {

2. Near the end of the file and above the comment section about "required for s-functions" add:

    }

3. Exit the file and rename it to sfun_xxx.cpp where "xxx" is the original name of the file.

ex:
    sfun_hmg.c --> sfun_hmg.cpp
