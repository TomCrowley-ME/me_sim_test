   README: VxWorks BSP for BeagleBone

This file contains board-specific information for the TI
AM335X platform which uses an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU on a Texas
Instruments AM335X processor. This file documents BSP interface
changes from previous software or hardware versions, and notifies the
user of serious caveats that must be noted before using this
BSP. Additionally, the target board's reference entry
(i.e. beaglebone/target.ref) provides board-specific information
necessary to run VxWorks and should be read fully before this BSP is
used.
