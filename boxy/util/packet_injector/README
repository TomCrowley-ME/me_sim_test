** Network Packet Injector **
*****************************


=== ABOUT ===
The included shell scripts automate modification and transmission of network packets
stored in a pcap file generated by network analysis tools, such as Wireshark.

Network packet injection allows for the testing of ground data systems without
directly executing the processes that generate telemetry output. This tool also
allows packet replay at lower output rates.



=== DEPENDECIES ===
 -bittwist
 -tcpdump



=== USE ===
1) To replay packets onto the network, first modify the source IP address, destination
MAC address, and the destination IP address (if multicast address is not already set)
using the packet_mod.sh script:

  ./packet_mod.sh linux_dump.pcap 10.0.0.1 5c:f9:dd:3e:72:63

2) Clients must be listening on the multicast IP address in the packet header. Check that
the Ethernet and IP headers are correct by executing the dump_pcap.sh script:

  ./dump_pcap.sh linux_dump.pcap

3) Replay the pcap file by injecting its contents onto the LAN. The second argument
specifies the output interval:

  ./inject_packets.sh linux_dump.pcap 0.1



=== NOTES ===
Non multicast IPs/clients do not seem to work with this tool.

Packet injection should be executed on a remote machine visible to telemetry clients on the LAN.
This has only been tested on the eth0 hardwired interface. I've had no success injecting packets
onto the loopback interface. Wireshark will see the traffic, but client applications do not.
This is a limitation of the localhost loopback.
